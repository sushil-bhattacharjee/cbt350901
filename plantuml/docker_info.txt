#Show both running and stopped containers (-a, --all)
#The docker ps command only shows running containers by default. To see all containers, use the --all (or -a) flag:
docker ps -a

#How to run a installed docker
docker run -d -p 8081:8080 plantuml/plantuml-server:tomcat
**note: since localhost@port=8080 is already consumed (ss -tuln, sudo ss -tulnp); 
	therefore, it requires to change the localhost port to 8081

docker run: This is the base Docker command used to start a new container.

-d: This flag runs the container in "detached" mode, meaning the container will run in the background and not block your terminal.

-p 8081:8080: This maps the container's internal port 8080 to port 8080 on the host machine.

    The format is host_port:container_port, so in this case, requests to http://localhost:8081 on your machine 
    will be forwarded to port 8080 inside the Docker container where the PlantUML server is running.

plantuml/plantuml-server:tomcat: This specifies the Docker image to use. In this case, it is the plantuml/plantuml-server image, 
tagged with the tomcat version (meaning it's running on Tomcat).
